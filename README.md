# Personality Analysis Framework

This framework allows users who tweet in Turkish to get an estimation of their Big Five OCEAN Personality scores via
their tweets.

As of October 2022, this project is inactive and no longer maintained.

## Academic Background

For academic background of this framework, please refer
to [Clustering based Personality Prediction on Turkish Tweets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9073214) by
Tutaysalgir, E., Karagoz, P. and Toroslu, I.H., 2019, August.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

## Requirements

* Python 3.8
* Java 8
* MySQL or MariaDB

For a list of required Python libraries, refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

## Services List

This framework uses 4 services to run properly. Namely,

1. [Zemberek](https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp) service
2. Word2Vec service
3. Backend REST service via Flask
4. Frontend service via React

### Zemberek Service

Zemberek provides the NLP functionalities for the framework. The communication between the framework and Zemberek is
achieved through gRPC.

To run Zemberek service, you can use ```run_zemberek.sh```.

### Word2Vec service

Word2Vec service provides an API to get Word2Vec representations of words. You can use ```run_word2vec.sh``` to run the
service.

### Backend REST service via Flask

The backend of this project relies on a RESTful API to allow any frontend or application to make requests and get
responses from it. To achieve this, we use Flask, which has a very simple but powerful interface.

This service is by nature multithreaded, and it spawns a new thread for every new vector calculation request to handle
multiple users at a time. If you expect a huge number of users at the same time, it might be useful to use autoscaling
solutions.

### Frontend service via React

The frontend is purely for aesthetics, and it is extremely under-developed. As long as making the proper REST requests,
any frontend should work just fine.

## Command Line Usage

Even though this framework is designed as a web tool, it is possible to use this through a terminal window as well. In
order to do so, follow these steps after installation:

1. Run Zemberek and Word2Vec services.
2. Fill in ```auth_pair``` in ```main.py``` with your credentials.
3. Run ```python main.py username``` if you want to give username as an argument, or ```python main.py``` to enter
   username when asked.
4. You will receive the predicted OCEAN score in the terminal.

## Reading from a CSV file

It is possible to download tweets of a user and use this csv file for the vector construction. In order to do so, do the
following steps:

1. Fill in ```auth_pair``` in ```download-tweets.py``` with your credentials.
2. Download tweets of a user via ```python download-tweets.py```. This will save the tweets in the ```data/tweets```
   folder.
3. Run the vector constructor via ```python main.py username --file``` arguments. This will read the tweets from the csv
   file instead of downloading them from scratch.

This method was implemented to avoid burning out the Twitter API for recurrent downloads.
